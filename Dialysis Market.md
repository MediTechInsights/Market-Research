The dialysis market is projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 8% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a growing geriatric population, rising adoption of home dialysis systems, and advancements in dialysis technology. However, high treatment costs and limited access to dialysis facilities in rural and underdeveloped regions pose significant challenges to market growth.
Dialysis is a medical procedure designed to remove waste products, toxins, and excess fluids from the blood in patients whose kidneys no longer function adequately. It is a life-saving treatment often used for patients with chronic kidney diseases or acute kidney injuries. The two primary forms of dialysis are hemodialysis, which filters blood through a machine, and peritoneal dialysis, which uses the peritoneum as a natural filter. Dialysis enables patients to manage their kidney failure and maintain a better quality of life.
