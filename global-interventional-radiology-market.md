<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1610" src="http://dailyinvestorhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Interventional-Radiology-Market.png" alt="" width="810" height="457" />

<strong><em>The </em></strong><a href="https://meditechinsights.com/interventional-radiology-market/"><strong><em>interventional radiology market</em></strong></a><strong><em> is projected to grow at a CAGR of ~6% over the forecast period.</em></strong>Â Major factors driving the growth include the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, technological advancements in imaging modalities, a shift towards minimally invasive procedures, rising awareness about the benefits of IR, and the growing application of interventional radiology in new treatment areas such as oncology and pain management.

Interventional radiology (also known as IR) is a minimally invasive, image-guided procedure for diagnosing and treating diseases in nearly every organ system. It utilizes imaging techniques such as X-ray, ultrasound,Â <strong>CT (computed tomography)</strong>, andÂ <strong>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)</strong>Â to guide small instruments like catheters and needles through the body to treat conditions without the need for open surgery.

<strong>Rising prevalence of chronic diseases drives market growth</strong>

The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and neurological conditions is a significant driver of the interventional radiology (IR) market. With the rising global burden of diseases like stroke, peripheral artery disease, and liver cancer, there is a growing need for minimally invasive procedures that offer faster recovery times, reduced complications, and improved patient outcomes. Interventional radiology techniques, including angioplasty, embolization, and tumor ablation, provide effective treatment options for managing these conditions without the need for traditional open surgery. The aging population further contributes to the demand for IR procedures, as older individuals are more susceptible to chronic illnesses requiring continuous monitoring and intervention. As healthcare systems worldwide prioritize early diagnosis and non-surgical treatment methods, the adoption of interventional radiology continues to expand, fueling market growth and technological advancements in imaging and catheter-based interventions.

<strong>Technological advancements in imaging modalities fuel its demand</strong>

Innovations in MRI, CT, ultrasound, and fluoroscopy have significantly enhanced the precision, safety, and effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures. High-resolution imaging, 3D/4D visualization, and AI-powered image analysis have added a layer of precision to IR procedures, allowing for real-time, three-dimensional visualizations of the targeted area. Coupled with AR, this technology provides radiologists with overlay images for more accurate interventions, reducing risks and improving outcomes. Additionally, portable and hybrid imaging systems are expanding access to IR in outpatient settings and remote areas. The integration of robotics and augmented reality further enhances procedural control and reduces radiation exposure for both patients and physicians. As imaging technologies continue to evolve, interventional radiology is poised for further expansion, offering safer and more effective alternatives to traditional surgical interventions. For instance, In June 2024, GE HealthCare and MediView XR Inc. announced the first installation of the OmnifyXR interventional suite at North Star Vascular and Interventional (NSVI) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This innovative augmented reality-based interventional radiology suite combines a holographic heads-up display streaming live medical imaging, 3D anatomy model visualization, and advanced imaging technologies while enabling the opportunity for remote collaboration to help advance the delivery of precision care across a variety of interventional procedures.
