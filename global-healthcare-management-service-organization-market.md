<strong>Advantages Offered by MSOs Fuels Its Demand</strong>

MSO is beneficial to a health system in numerous ways:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Improved Quality and Better Efficiency: </strong>Due to a common governance structure care management delivery across the organization is standardized. Population health reporting and analytics member identification, risk stratification, attribution, care management delivery, and staffing are all streamlined, which in turn results in performance improvement and better utilization</li>
 	<li><strong>Economies of Scale: </strong>MSOs urge the health systems to scout for partnerships, increase membership, and cut per-member-per-month (PMPM) management expenses by creating economies of scale</li>
 	<li><strong>Network Expansion: </strong>MSOs offer a competitive edge to healthcare organizations as they relieve them from performing administrative and managerial responsibilities. MSOs serve as an incentive for health organizations that are looking to expand their network</li>
</ul>
"MSO<em> ensures access to the lowest prices of medical supplies and services... MSOs aggregate volumes and hence are able to achieve economies of scale, which in turn allows them to obtain preferred pricing on medical supplies, healthcare insurance, etc."</em>

<strong>Foray of Next-Generation MSOs in Orthopedics – An Emerging Trend</strong>

Orthopedic physician practices often face challenges such as high overhead costs, deteriorating payments, increased regulatory requirements, and payer and administrative hurdles. On average, orthopedic physician practices spend ~ 50% of their revenue on overheads. To overcome these challenges, a new type of MSO has ventured into the market that not only provides orthopedic physician practices the tools they need to streamline business functions but also provides technical expertise to succeed.

For instance,
<ul>
 	<li><strong>In June 2022,</strong> a coalition of leading independent orthopaedic and musculoskeletal (MSK) specialists announced the launch of MedVanta, the nation's largest physician-owned and operated musculoskeletal management services organization. MedVanta offers next-generation MSO strategies, people, processes, technology and solutions to independent orthopaedic and MSK practices for transforming business operations.</li>
</ul>
