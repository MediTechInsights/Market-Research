<strong><em>The </em></strong><a href="http://meditechinsights.com/allergy-diagnostics-market/"><strong><em>global allergy diagnostics market</em></strong></a><strong><em> is set to witness a healthy growth rate of 11% in the next 5 years.</em></strong>¬†Growing cases of allergic diseases (asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy), rising environmental pollution levels, high volume consumption of processed food and beverages, the advent of mHealth in allergy diagnosis &amp; care and growing awareness about allergic diseases are some of the key factors driving the market.

Allergies¬†are the body‚Äôs reaction to a substance it considers a harmful ‚Äúinvader.‚Äù Substances that cause these reactions are called allergens. An individual can be allergic to a wide variety of substances including pollen, food and drug, animal dander, moulds, insect venom, latex, and dust mites, among others. Allergic diseases are a global health problem that affects approximately 20-30% of the population in industrialized countries. The prevalence of allergic diseases globally has continued to grow in the industrialized world for more than 50 years. Allergic diseases such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, anaphylaxis, and food and drug allergies are complex and cause a broad spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to severe and potentially life-threatening anaphylactic reactions.

According to The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), allergies are the 6th leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. and each year more than 50 million Americans experience various types of allergies. Continuously rising cases of allergic diseases and other related medical conditions has fueled the global allergy diagnostics market.

<strong>High Volume Consumption of Processed Food and Beverages Set to Spur the Food Allergen Testing Market</strong>

Food allergens continue to prevail as high-risk factors for the food production industry. The food allergen testing industry has garnered considerable traction globally because of high daily consumption of processed food and beverages. Allergens are a significant cause for concern in the global food processing industry. Food allergies which include abnormal reactions or hypersensitivity produced by the body‚Äôs immune system are considered a major food safety challenge. The food allergen testing market is anticipated to witness considerable momentum in the coming years due to the growth of the dairy, processed food and confectionary segments. Allergen detection tests are a key feature of allergen management systems in food processing plants and are executed at nearly every step of the process. These tests are carried out on work surfaces and products to detect any cross contamination or allergen presence and to test the effectiveness of a food processing unit‚Äôs cleaning measures<strong>.</strong>

<strong>Growing Prominence of mHealth in Allergy Diagnosis &amp; Allergy Care</strong>

The widespread availability of technology-based interventions such as mobile health in the clinical setting has enabled patients to play an active role in their medical care.¬†<strong>Mobile health</strong>¬†(mHealth) utilizes mobile communication devices such as computers, tablets and smartphones to improve patient education &amp; self-management of diseases, help in remote surveillance of patient health, the flow of data and information and disease management from first diagnosis to an optimized treatment.

The advent of patient-facing mHealth technologies (such as apps) is expected to favourably impact clinical, economic and process outcomes. Features such as medication reminders, educational content, games-based self-management, symptom diaries, electronic sensors, patient self-tracking dashboards, voice recognition, wearable technology, pollen sensors, and virtual reality offered by apps not only improve patient knowledge but also improve medication adherence, asthma and allergic conditions control, quality of life and results in fewer unscheduled office visits.

<strong>mHealth</strong>¬†offers allergists and patients a new mode of communication via the phone camera, sound recording system, motion sensors, texting, and by using diagnostic devices and diagnostic algorithms incorporated in the smartphone itself.
