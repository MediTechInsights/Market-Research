<strong>Consumer Shift Toward Natural and Organic Products</strong>

A growing consumer preference for natural and organic products is significantly driving the herbal medicinal products market. People increasingly seek alternatives to synthetic drugs, valuing the minimal side effects and sustainability of herbal remedies. Rising health awareness and an emphasis on preventive care have also contributed to this trend.
