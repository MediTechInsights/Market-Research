Varicose vein treatment refers to medical procedures and therapies aimed at managing and eliminating varicose veins, enlarged, twisted veins that commonly occur in the legs due to faulty valves and poor blood circulation. Treatment options include minimally invasive procedures like endovenous laser therapy (EVLT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and sclerotherapy among others, as well as surgical methods like vein stripping and ligation. These treatments help relieve symptoms such as pain, swelling, and skin ulcers while improving both aesthetic appearance and vascular health. Advancements in non-thermal, non-tumescent techniques are expanding safer, more effective treatment options with minimal downtime.
