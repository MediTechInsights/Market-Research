<strong>Rising Prevalence of Arthritis and Other Knee Conditions Driving Demand for Knee Reconstruction Devices</strong>

The increasing prevalence of knee-related conditions, such as osteoarthritis, is significantly impacting the demand for knee reconstruction devices. According to the WHO, more than 500 million people worldwide affected by osteoarthritis currently, a number expected to rise due to aging populations and lifestyle factors. Similarly, the Arthritis Foundation estimates that by 2040, 78 million adults in the US alone will have doctor-diagnosed arthritis, with knee osteoarthritis being the most common form. This growing burden is coupled with an increase in knee injuries from sports and other high-impact activities. In the U.S., more than 700,000 knee replacement surgeries are performed annually, a figure projected to exceed 1.2 million by 2030, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS). The growing prevalence of these knee conditions likely to drive the growth of knee reconstruction devices market.
