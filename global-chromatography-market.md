<strong><em>The </em></strong><a href="https://meditechinsights.com/chromatography-market/"><strong><em>chromatography market</em></strong></a><strong><em> is growing steadily, with a 6% CAGR from 2025 to 2030,Â </em></strong>driven by regulatory demands in pharmaceuticals and food safety, increasing applications in environmental monitoring, biotechnology, and forensic testing, as well as rising adoption in cannabis regulation and biomarker research. However, high equipment and maintenance costs remain key barriers to widespread adoption.

Chromatography is an analytical technique used to separate, identify, and quantify components in a mixture. It involves a stationary phase and a mobile phase, where the analyte interacts with both phases to achieve separation based on specific physical or chemical properties. Chromatography is widely applied in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food safety, environmental testing, and forensics. Its versatility and precision make it a critical tool in both research and quality control processes.
