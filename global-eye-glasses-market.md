<strong>Aging population and increased demand for prescription glasses to propel market demand</strong>

The aging population is a key driver of the eyeglasses market, as vision deteriorates with age, leading to increased demand for prescription glasses. Age-related conditions like presbyopia, cataracts, and macular degeneration necessitate corrective eyewear for clear vision. As life expectancy rises, more individuals require reading glasses or multifocal lenses to manage daily activities. Additionally, advancements in lightweight frames and high-quality lenses enhance comfort for elderly users. With growing healthcare awareness, seniors actively seek vision correction solutions, boosting market growth. The expanding elderly demographic worldwide ensures a sustained demand for prescription eyeglasses, strengthening the industryâ€™s long-term prospects.

<strong>Rise in number of eye disorders in the younger generation are driving the market growth</strong>

The increasing prevalence of eye disorders among the younger generation is driving the eyeglasses market. Excessive screen time from digital devices, prolonged studying, and reduced outdoor activities contribute to rising cases of myopia and digital eye strain. Early onset of refractive errors necessitates prescription glasses for vision correction, boosting market demand. Additionally, blue-light filtering lenses are gaining popularity among students and young professionals to reduce eye fatigue. Fashion trends and brand-conscious preferences further fuel the adoption of stylish eyewear. As vision issues among youth continue to grow, the demand for eyeglasses remains strong across global markets.
