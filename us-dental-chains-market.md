<strong>Increasing consolidation of independent dental practices to propel market demand</strong>

The increasing consolidation of independent <strong>dental practices</strong> into dental chains, often managed by DSOs, is a significant driver of the US dental chains market. This trend enables streamlined operations, centralized administrative tasks, and cost efficiencies, allowing dentists to focus on patient care.
