<strong><em>The </em></strong><a href="https://meditechinsights.com/therapeutic-drug-monitoring-market/"><strong><em>global therapeutic drug monitoring market</em></strong></a><strong><em> is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 8% during the forecast period. </em></strong>The market growth is primarily driven by the expansion of personalized medicine, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that need long-term pharmacotherapy, and the increased focus on patient safety through optimal drug dosing. The market growth is, however, moderately restrained by the high cost of TDM devices and reduced access in resource-scarce healthcare environments.

Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is a clinical application aimed at measuring the concentration of certain drugs in the patient’s blood at specific time intervals. The main goal is to maintain medication in the therapeutic range—sufficient to be beneficial but not enough to result in toxicity. TDM is commenced by sample collection (generally blood sample), then analyzed in the laboratory by using immunoassays or chromatographic techniques. It is very important for individualizing drug treatment regimens with a narrow therapeutic window, maximizing drug efficacy and patient safety.

<strong>Increasing Prevalence of Chronic Diseases Requiring Long-Term Medication</strong>

One of the key drivers of the widespread adoption of TDM devices is the global rise in chronic conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy and autoimmune diseases, which require frequent monitoring and prolonged treatment with drugs that have narrow therapeutic windows, including immunosuppressants, antiepileptics, and some antibiotics. In these instances, it is important to sustain drug levels in a specified range—both to avoid underdosing and overdosing. Since chronic illnesses require ongoing and accurate dosing over weeks or months, physicians are now relying more on TDM to individualize treatment regimens and improve patient safety. Additionally, the rising geriatric population and the common use of complex drug regimens (mainly in oncology and transplant medicine) have further expanded the clinical relevance of TDM. This emerging medical need is directly correlating with increased demand for monitoring devices and services by hospitals and diagnostic laboratories.

<strong>Integration of Microsampling Techniques in Therapeutic Drug Monitoring</strong>

One of the most significant innovations augmenting TDM is the creation of microsampling technologies, including volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) and dried blood spot (DBS) testing. These technologies enable the collection of very small volumes of blood—often a few microliters—via minimally invasive procedures like finger pricks. In contrast to standard venipuncture, microsampling does not involve skilled phlebotomists or large volumes of blood, so it is less invasive for patients and more convenient for outpatient or home settings. Microsampling is particularly valuable with pediatric, geriatric, and rural populations, where standard sampling proves difficult. The less complicated logistics also allow for samples to be taken in non-clinical settings and sent by mail to central labs without requiring cold chain shipping. As a result, microsampling has enhanced the patient compliance and feasibility considerably in standard TDM programs, thus facilitating broader use and increased monitoring in clinical practice.
